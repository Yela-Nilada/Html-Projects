    <h1>HOW TO SPEND A WEEKEND</h1>
    <P>Weendends are for shenanigans! Start by sleeping in till noon - it's the responsible thing to do after a late nuight of watching tv.<br> Next, tackle "adulting" tasks like laundry and grocery dhopping. Make it fun by pretending you are a secret agent on a mission to find the perfect snack. <br> Sunday funday is all about relaxation. Binge-watch your favorite shows, eat an entire pizza by yourself (no judgements. Haha!), and take epic naps. <br> You can get creative! Write a ridiculous story or poem, draw a silly cartoon, or compose a song about yourlife's latest shege incidence. End your weekend with a snore, ready to take on the week.</P>
